Hey, my name is Devin!

I am a first-year PhD student at the University of Delaware studying Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. 

My passion lies at the intersection of engineering, data science, and information technology-foundational disciplines for developing innovative solutions in energy and chemistry.
